| `get_cards` | Retrieve card details from the banking core system, optionally filtered by various parameters including dates, status, and identifiers. Returns both physical and linked virtual cards. |
| `card_request` | Requests the creation of a new prepaid card. This method initiates an asynchronous card creation process and always requires a physical card, even for virtual cards. |

| `emboss` | Embosses a physical card by sending a PATCH request to the specified URL with the provided request body. |

| `card_password_change` | Activates a physical card by updating its password and changing its status to 'active'. |
